Treehouse Work Log Python Project
=================================

This is my run at the Treehouse Work Log Project for the Python/Django Course. 

Running
-------

The project was built and tested with Python 3. Clone the repo and run it from the repo directory with:

    python3 worklog.py


Example Log File Included
-------------------------

The task log data is stored in the file:

    data.csv

I've included a sample version in the repository to ease in testing. (Normally, that file would be excluded from the repository in a production application.)

To start fresh, simply delete it. 


No Extra Credit
---------------

I added a `quit` option to the main menu. Other than that, I didn't spend time on the extra credit features. 

My priority is getting to the Django portions of the course instead of building command line interfaces.

UI Notes
--------

The UI is based off selecting menu items by number. The menus to look up by date and time spent will get unwieldy as the number of dates/tasks increases. While pagination would address that, this is another case where my time is better spent progressing in the course than in working on command line user interfaces.
